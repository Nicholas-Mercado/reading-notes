# Operators and loops

## Loops with Programs

What is a Loops
- a set of operations that are done more then once
- does more things
- 3 tpyes: for, while, do while

### for Loops

3 things that go here
first is a vairable that should be a number
the second is a condition, when the condition is false it should stop
the third is a update to the inializer

times -- === times - 1

for (let times=5; times>0; times--) {
    console.log('this loop has run' + times 'many times');
}


### while loops

The parantheses only contains condition
while(!likewatermelons){
let likewatermelons = confrim("like watermelon>?")}



``` for (let times=11; times<0; times= times -1) {
     console.log(times);}


while(!likewatermelons){
    let likewatermelons = confrim("like watermelon>?")}

let num = 6;
    while(num < 50){
        console.log(num); num = num + 1}

```
### Operators
- Java script has both binary and unary Operators and one special tenary operator.

#### binary operator
- a binary operator requires two operands
- one before and one after the operator

```
3+4 or c*t
```
#### unary operator
- requires a single operands
  
```
  x++ or ++x
  ```
### Assignment operators

-   assigns value of a left operands based on right operands
```
x=f()
```
- assigns value of f() to x

### Comparison operators
- compares its operands and returns a logical value based on wether it is a true Comparison

- Equals (==)
- not equals(!=)
- strict equals(===)- must be of same type 
- strict not equals(!==)
- Greater then (>)
- Greater than or equal(>=)
- Less than (<)
- Less than or equal (<=)
