 ## A little about myself ##

  Hi y'all, my name is Nicholas Mercado(he/him) and I live in Federal way WA. I most recently worked as an electrician and decided to change my career so I have been teaching myself some coding the past few months in my free time. I am rocking Windows 10 pro 21H1. I am always excited to learn new things, solve puzzles, and especially excited to learn some Javascript.
