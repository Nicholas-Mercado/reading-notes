# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

**What is functional programming?**

Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

**What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

We know if a funciont is pure if it returnes the same result if given the same arguments and it does not cause side effects.
**What are the benefits of a pure function?**

Pure functions are much easier to read and understand the reason.

**What is immutability?**
unchanging over time or unable to be changed

**What is Referential transparency?**

Referential transparency means given a function a input you will receive the same output. No external state used in the function.
