# REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

Smart guy! He helped write the first web servers that sent data across the internet.

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

Most of the techniques that developers used later were just to get computers to talk to small groups of computers.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

Representational State Transfer (REST)

**What does a GET do?**

How one computer system retrieves information from another

**What does a POST do?**

How one computer system adds information from another

**What does PUT do?**

How one computer system replaces information on another system

**What does PATCH do?**

How a computer system does a partial update
