# Introduction to React and Components

## Component-Based Architecture

**What is a “component”?**
A *Component* is a portable replaceable piece of modular code that can be easily reused. It is intended to interact with other component and has a specific functionality.

**What are the characteristics of a component?**

1. Reusability - Component are designed to be used in different situations but can be made to be more specific.

2. Replaceable - Component may be interchanged with other similar components

3. Not context specific - designed to work in many environments

4. Extensible - Component can be extended to provide a new behavior

5. Encapsulated - Depict the interface and do not expose details of the internal processes

6. Independent - Have minimal dependencies on other Components

**What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?**

1. Ease of deployment - Easily replaced with newer component

2. Reduced cost - By using third party components you are diluting the cost of development

3. Development - Allow the implementation of well known interfaces without impacting the whole system

4. Reusable - Being able to reuse component spread the cost of develop

5. Reliability - Each individual component is more reliable so the whole system becomes more reliable

6. System maintenance - Easy to preform maintenance without affecting system

7. Independent - Multiple groups can develop components in parallel allowing fo more productivity

## What is Props and How to Use it in React

**What is “props” short for?**
Props is a keyword in React that stands for properties

**How are props used in React?**
Props are used in three steps

1. Define a attribute and its value

2. pass that data to a child component by using Props

3. Render the props data 

**What is the flow of props?**

props flow in one direction from parent to child element
