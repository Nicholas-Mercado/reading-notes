## What is the Growth Mindset

I feel the growth mindset is a way of moving forward with openness. A way of learning through both success and frustration and knowing that the only real way to fail is to give up[^1]. 


### What I learned about having a Growth Mindset


1. Always be open to new ideas  
2. Its ok even great to not know something
3. Getting to the solution is just as important as the solution itself


### Ways to remind my self to have a Growth Mindset

- Always remeber what my 3rd grade music teacher told me.
  
  > There is no such thing as perfect, only better

- Its ok to fail, nto give up

- Its ok even great to not know something
