## Pain and Suffering

- This hit pretty close to home. A couple of key points I found in the article tha really spoke to me. "Don’t experience the pain in silence".
I have the tendecy to bunker down and not ask for help when I can not figure something out. Sometimes thi scan spiral and become a real time suck.
- The second thing that I really took to hear was "Find the common thread that makes the pain worthwhile, that puts the pain into perspective. You’re here because you chose to invest in a different life. A better life.". Keeping my eye on the prize even when I feel horrible really helps.

## Beginners Guide to Big O

Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario

*O(1)* describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

*O(N)* describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

*O(N²)* represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

- For each nested loop add power.. N<sup>3</sup> N<sup>4</sup>

*O(2^N)* denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

- growth curve for this is exponential

## Names and Values in Python

Assignment never copies data- assign to a new variable does not make more data

Mutable aliasing - when we use a method it changes the value.

Immutable values cannot aliasing types:

- ints
- floats
- strings
- tuples

### rebinding

x = x + 1

### mutating

nums.append(7)

Instead of mutating data make a new data

Names have no type and values have no scope
