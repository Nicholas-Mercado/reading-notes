# Prep Your Mindset

## *Upgrade** Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice

  What a amazing quote -

  Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety.
  <cite>Cal Newport</cite>

  The key ideas I find are most helpful for me is:

Repeated often - I often need to repeat tasks for them to sink in

It's highly demanding mentally - even though I find this exhausting, I have noticed these task tend to teach me the most

It requires good goals - I am all about goals!!

## Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset'

  Every time I watch Carol Dweck I am reminded of the following

- Not Yet give you a path towards the future

- Don't get stuck in the tyranny of now

- Abilities / talent are not fixed and can be developed

## Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit

  What if what you need in life is more then the ability to learn quickly and easily

  love this question : who is successfully here and why?

  one characteristic being successful is grit

  Follow through or grit, is most likely inverse to talent level

## Alain de Botton on Redefining Success

Snobbery is very real and is attached to our social hierarchy though jobs

The closer people are age, and in background the higher risk of envy

We fear failure most because of judgment and ridicule of others
