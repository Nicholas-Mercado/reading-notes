## What is Risk Analysis

**Risk analysis** -  is the process of finding and identifying possible unwanted incidents in your software.

### Risk Categories

High - The Risk may cause company loss, not tolerable

Medium - The company may suffer loss but that is limited

Low - This risk is tolerable, no to little loss

## Test Coverage

Its not the quantity of testing but the quality of testing that matters

Two ways you know you are doing enough testing

- There are very few bugs that make it to production

- You will change code without fear it will cause production bugs.

## Things I want to know more about

I am interested in looking at a full suite of test and what the natural evolution was in there creation. I also think seeing a Risk Analysis worked though would be enlightening.
