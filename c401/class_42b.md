This ethical quandary is not unique to the software development field. I have in one way or another been put in a situation that tests my ethics in almost every job I have had. I think the difference is, in software development, it is much easier to not notice or ignore on purpose the implications of your code. Mostly because the effects of your choices are not readily apparent. We must ask ourselves, if the author had never seen that news story would he have even thought twice about his involvement? I think because of this degree of separation we must be ever more vigilant to look past the problem in front of us to the possible consequences of our actions and are work.

## The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars

The article makes the point that we might be asking too much from driverless cars vs what we ask from people today. Should we give humans more leeway when a split second decision goes wrong over an AI? While self-driving cars may be able to decrease accidents by 90%, all the public will see is the 10% of people who are killed by AI. While the laws will be shaped by private companies, legislation and public opinion, I think, because of the litigiousness of our society, the driving force will be liability. Who owes what after a wrongful death suit will most likely be the overarching force that helps to navigate our transition to driverless cars.
