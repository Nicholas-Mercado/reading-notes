# Stacks and Queues

[Great video that I found explains the basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3ZUpyrnCbM)

## Stack

## Stack analogy

Think about it like a pile or stack of heavy weights. If you wanted to move that pile of weights and you were not strong enough to pick up the whole stack, what would you do? You would have to take one weight off at a time.  This is the fundamental of stacks

FILO - First In Last Out

### Common terminology Stack

Push - Nodes that are put into the stack

Pop - removing a node from the stack

Top - This is the top of the stack.

Peek - Checking the value on the top of the stack

IsEmpty - Returns true when stack is empty

## Queue

## Queue analogy

This data structure is very much like waiting in line at the grocery store. If you are the last to get  to the line, of course you have to go to the back of the line and wait your turn. The person at the front of the line get to checkout first, naturally.

LILO - Last In Last Out

### Common terminology Queue

Enqueue - Nodes that are added

Dequeue - Nodes that are removed

Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.

Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.

Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.

IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
