# Cryptography

## Encryption, Decryption & Hacking

three main techniques to crack a cipher

- Frequency analysis - analyze the frequency of common characters in a given message

- Known plaintext - if you know part of the encryption you can use original encrypted message to decrypting the message

- Brute force - literally try everything

## Cryptography Crash Course

Cryptography is one of the most common forms of computer security

Cipher - is a algorithm that converts plain text into Ciphertext

Encryption - The process of making text secret

Decryption - the reverse of encryption

### Key exchange

 **key exchange** - is a algorithm that lets two computers argee on a key with out sending one

 This is done with,

 **one way functions** - mathematical operations that are easy to do one way but difficult to reverse
