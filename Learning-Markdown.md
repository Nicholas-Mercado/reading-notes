# Learning Markdown

## What is Markdown
  
  Think of markdown as a full customizable format bar. Instead of hitting buttons and menus you use symbols to format your text! This is great for a few reasons!

- Almost all Markdown apps support a basic syntax
- Allows you to publish straight to html
- Makes it so you do not have to redo work for multiple platforms
