## 6 Steps to make a Wireframe

### 2. Prepare your research for reference
- create a cheat sheet with user goals, personas, use cases and features

### 3. Map out your user flow
- Have your concept of user flow ready
- Where there start and where you need them to end up
- This will lead to higher retention
### 4. This is just a draft
- no final deatail at this point
- just large thoughts
- use a thick marker
- don't drown in detail 
### 5. Add some details
- Start adding some details
- This is not the muscle its the ligaments 
- Think about usability ( where does nav go?)
- try making simple instructions 
### 6. Start turing wireframe into protoypes 
- Once you have documented and used feedback its time to start laying the muscle 
- Import your wireframe into a prototyping tool and begin to build
