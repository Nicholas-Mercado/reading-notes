# Growth Mindset

## What is the Growth Mindset

I feel the growth mindset is a way of moving forward with openness. A way of learning through both success and frustration and knowing that the only real way to fail is to give up[^1]. 


### What I learned about having a Growth Mindset


1. Always be open to new ideas  
2. Its ok to not know something
3. Getting to the solution is just as important as the solution itself


### Ways to remind my self to have a Growth Mindset

- Always remeber what my 3rd grade music teacher told me.
  
  > There is no such thing as perfect, only better

- Its ok to fail, not give up

- Its ok even, great to not know something
