# What is CSS?

*CSS*  (Cascading Style Sheets)
- Allows you to create and styles webpages with a simple syntax


## CSS syntax

- css is a rules based language
- you define rules
- those rules are applied to specific elements of the page

The following is a simple code 



> h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

- This rule is open with a selector
  - This selects the HTML tag
- Then we have {} 
  - This is where we will add declarations
    - declarations are a form of property and value pairs
    - Befor the colon is the property
    - before the semi colon is the value

**A css sheet will contain many of these rules, written one after the other**


## CSS Modules

### There are so many styles in CSS it is often broken down into Modules
  - These modules are just groups of properties that are similar 
  - Background-color and Border-color are in the same Modules
  - Just making it easier to search for


## CSS Specifications

All web Standards techs are defined int huge docs called Specifications. These are published by standard organizations like
- W3C
- WHATWG
- ECMA
- Khronos

Css is developed by a group call CSS Working group
- This group is made up of two groups
  - reps of browser venders
  - and invited experts

Css features are developed for multiple reasons
  -  A browser wants different capability
  - Web developers are asking for a features
- The working group has identified a requirement
